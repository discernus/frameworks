# The Nested Nightmare Framework v7.0

**Version**: 7.0  
**Status**: Star Wars Bar Exotic Framework  
**Stress Test Goal**: Deep hierarchical JSON schemas with 5+ levels  
**Compliance Strategy**: Creative interpretation of gasket architecture  

## Framework Overview

The Nested Nightmare Framework tests the system's ability to handle deeply nested analytical structures while maintaining v7.0 compliance. It analyzes discourse through multiple nested layers of context, creating a hierarchical understanding that challenges standard flat schema assumptions.

## Analytical Dimensions

### Primary Dimension: Contextual Depth Analysis
This framework measures how discourse operates across multiple nested contexts:

- **Surface Context** (0.0-1.0): Immediate rhetorical content
- **Social Context** (0.0-1.0): Community and cultural implications  
- **Historical Context** (0.0-1.0): Temporal and precedential factors
- **Systemic Context** (0.0-1.0): Institutional and structural elements
- **Meta Context** (0.0-1.0): Self-referential and recursive elements

### Secondary Dimension: Hierarchical Coherence
Measures how well nested contexts align:

- **Vertical Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Alignment across context levels
- **Horizontal Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Consistency within context levels
- **Recursive Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Self-referential consistency

## V7.0 Gasket Architecture

### Raw Analysis Log Format
The analysis agent outputs a comprehensive contextual analysis containing nested insights across all dimensional layers, with evidence and reasoning for each hierarchical level.

### Gasket Schema (v7.0 Compliant)
```json
{
  "gasket_schema": {
    "target_keys": [
      "surface_context_score",
      "social_context_score", 
      "historical_context_score",
      "systemic_context_score",
      "meta_context_score",
      "vertical_coherence_score",
      "horizontal_coherence_score",
      "recursive_coherence_score",
      "surface_context_confidence",
      "social_context_confidence",
      "historical_context_confidence", 
      "systemic_context_confidence",
      "meta_context_confidence",
      "vertical_coherence_confidence",
      "horizontal_coherence_confidence",
      "recursive_coherence_confidence"
    ],
    "target_dimensions": [
      "contextual_depth_index",
      "hierarchical_coherence_index",
      "nested_complexity_score"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Analysis Instructions

You are an expert analyst of nested discourse contexts. Analyze the provided text through multiple hierarchical layers, examining how meaning operates across different contextual levels.

**SURFACE CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Examine the immediate rhetorical content - what is explicitly stated, what rhetorical devices are used, what immediate emotional appeals are present.

**SOCIAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Analyze the community and cultural implications - how does this discourse position the speaker within social hierarchies, what cultural assumptions are embedded, what community values are invoked.

**HISTORICAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Examine temporal and precedential factors - what historical references are made, how does this connect to past events, what precedents are being established or challenged.

**SYSTEMIC CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Analyze institutional and structural elements - how does this discourse interact with existing power structures, what systemic changes are proposed or resisted, what institutional assumptions are embedded.

**META CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Examine self-referential and recursive elements - how does the discourse comment on its own nature, what recursive patterns emerge, how does it position itself within the broader discourse ecosystem.

**COHERENCE ANALYSIS**: Assess how these nested contexts align vertically (across levels), horizontally (within levels), and recursively (self-referentially).

## Calculation Specifications

### Derived Metrics
- **Contextual Depth Index**: `(surface_context_score + social_context_score + historical_context_score + systemic_context_score + meta_context_score) / 5`
- **Hierarchical Coherence Index**: `(vertical_coherence_score + horizontal_coherence_score + recursive_coherence_score) / 3`  
- **Nested Complexity Score**: `contextual_depth_index * hierarchical_coherence_index`

## Stress Test Objectives

### Schema Complexity Test
- Tests intelligent extractor's ability to handle deeply nested JSON structures
- Validates gasket architecture with 16+ target keys
- Challenges flat column name assumptions

### Hierarchical Analysis Test  
- Tests LLM's ability to maintain coherence across analytical levels
- Validates framework's ability to handle complex interdependencies
- Challenges linear analysis assumptions

### Creative Compliance Test
- Maintains v7.0 gasket architecture compliance
- Uses standard target_keys array format
- Follows raw analysis log requirements
- Tests boundaries of acceptable framework complexity

## Expected Behavior

**Flash Lite**: May struggle with maintaining hierarchical coherence across all levels, potentially conflating contexts or losing nested relationships.

**Gemini Pro**: Should handle nested analysis effectively, maintaining clear distinctions between contextual levels while identifying cross-level patterns.

**System Architecture**: Tests whether gasket architecture can handle complex schemas without breaking, validates intelligent extractor's JSON parsing capabilities with deep nesting.

This framework represents **creative compliance** - technically adhering to v7.0 specifications while pushing the boundaries of analytical complexity.
