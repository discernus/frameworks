# The Nested Nightmare Framework v7.3

**Version**: 7.1  
**Status**: Star Wars Bar Exotic Framework  
**Stress Test Goal**: Deep hierarchical JSON schemas with 5+ levels using Enhanced Gasket Schema
**Compliance Strategy**: Creative interpretation of gasket architecture with v7.3 metadata scores  

## Framework Overview

The Nested Nightmare Framework v7.3 tests the system's ability to handle deeply nested analytical structures while maintaining v7.3 compliance with enhanced gasket schema. It analyzes discourse through multiple nested layers of context with metadata scores (salience and confidence), creating a hierarchical understanding that challenges standard flat schema assumptions.

## Analytical Dimensions

### Primary Dimension: Contextual Depth Analysis
This framework measures how discourse operates across multiple nested contexts:

- **Surface Context** (0.0-1.0): Immediate rhetorical content
- **Social Context** (0.0-1.0): Community and cultural implications  
- **Historical Context** (0.0-1.0): Temporal and precedential factors
- **Systemic Context** (0.0-1.0): Institutional and structural elements
- **Meta Context** (0.0-1.0): Self-referential and recursive elements

### Secondary Dimension: Hierarchical Coherence
Measures how well nested contexts align:

- **Vertical Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Alignment across context levels
- **Horizontal Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Consistency within context levels
- **Recursive Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Self-referential consistency

## V7.1 Enhanced Gasket Architecture

### Raw Analysis Log Format
The analysis agent outputs a comprehensive contextual analysis containing nested insights across all dimensional layers, with evidence and reasoning for each hierarchical level.

You are an expert analyst of nested discourse contexts. Analyze the provided text through multiple hierarchical layers, examining how meaning operates across different contextual levels.

**SURFACE CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Examine the immediate rhetorical content - what is explicitly stated, what rhetorical devices are used, what immediate emotional appeals are present.

**SOCIAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Analyze the community and cultural implications - how does this discourse position the speaker within social hierarchies, what cultural assumptions are embedded, what community values are invoked.

**HISTORICAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Examine temporal and precedential factors - what historical references are made, how does this connect to past events, what precedents are being established or challenged.

**SYSTEMIC CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Analyze institutional and structural elements - how does this discourse interact with existing power structures, what systemic changes are proposed or resisted, what institutional assumptions are embedded.

**META CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: Examine self-referential and recursive elements - how does the discourse comment on its own nature, what recursive patterns emerge, how does it position itself within the broader discourse ecosystem.

**COHERENCE ANALYSIS**: Assess how these nested contexts align vertically (across levels), horizontally (within levels), and recursively (self-referentially).

## Calculation Specifications

### Derived Metrics
- **Contextual Depth Index**: `(surface_context_score + social_context_score + historical_context_score + systemic_context_score + meta_context_score) / 5`
- **Hierarchical Coherence Index**: `(vertical_coherence_score + horizontal_coherence_score + recursive_coherence_score) / 3`  
- **Nested Complexity Score**: `contextual_depth_index * hierarchical_coherence_index`

## Stress Test Objectives

### Schema Complexity Test
- Tests intelligent extractor's ability to handle deeply nested JSON structures
- Validates gasket architecture with 16+ target keys
- Challenges flat column name assumptions

### Hierarchical Analysis Test  
- Tests LLM's ability to maintain coherence across analytical levels
- Validates framework's ability to handle complex interdependencies
- Challenges linear analysis assumptions

### Creative Compliance Test
- Maintains v7.3 gasket architecture compliance with enhanced metadata scores
- Uses advanced extraction patterns with flexible regex matching
- Follows raw analysis log requirements with salience weighting
- Tests boundaries of acceptable framework complexity with 24+ target keys

## Expected Behavior

**Flash Lite**: May struggle with maintaining hierarchical coherence across all levels, potentially conflating contexts or losing nested relationships.

**Gemini Pro**: Should handle nested analysis effectively, maintaining clear distinctions between contextual levels while identifying cross-level patterns.

**System Architecture**: Tests whether gasket architecture can handle complex schemas without breaking, validates intelligent extractor's JSON parsing capabilities with deep nesting.

This framework represents **creative compliance** - technically adhering to v7.3 specifications while pushing the boundaries of analytical complexity with enhanced metadata scoring and advanced extraction patterns.
