# Character Assessment Framework (CAF) v4.2 - Salience-Weighted
## Speaker Moral Character Assessment with Salience-Enhanced Analysis

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Character Assessment Framework (CAF) v4.2 analyzes the moral character displayed by speakers in political discourse through **salience-weighted character assessment**, based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. This framework evaluates what civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, using **empirically-backed salience weighting** rather than arbitrary researcher assumptions about character trait importance.

**Core Purpose**: CAF provides systematic assessment of political leaders' moral fitness for democratic citizenship and governance by analyzing the civic virtues and vices they display in public communication, weighted by actual rhetorical emphasis patterns rather than predetermined hierarchies.

**Version 4.2 Innovation**: **Salience-weighted character assessment** - analyzes not just what virtues and vices are present, but which character dimensions speakers emphasize most in their rhetorical strategy, enabling empirically-grounded character evaluation.

**Key Applications**:
- **Leadership Character Evaluation**: Assess moral fitness based on speakers' actual character emphasis patterns
- **Democratic Citizenship Education**: Identify character priorities through salience analysis  
- **Political Ethics Research**: Study relationships between character salience patterns and leadership effectiveness
- **Accountability Assessment**: Evaluate character consistency using empirically-backed weighting
- **Succession Planning**: Character-based evaluation using actual demonstrated priorities

## What is Salience-Weighted Character Assessment?

### **Salience in Character Analysis**

**Salience** = How much rhetorical emphasis the speaker places on each character dimension, regardless of raw intensity scores.

**Key Insight**: A speaker might demonstrate moderate Truth-telling (0.6 intensity) consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly displaying intense Justice language (1.0 intensity) in one section. The Truth dimension has much higher **salience** (0.8) than Justice (0.2) despite lower raw intensity.

**Why This Matters for Character Assessment**:
- **Character Priorities**: Reveals which virtues/vices speakers prioritize in their moral identity
- **Strategic Character**: Shows which character traits speakers invest the most rhetorical effort in demonstrating  
- **Authentic Assessment**: Uses actual character emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about trait importance

### **Research Foundation**

**Previous versions (v4.1 and earlier)** used static weights (Primary 1.0, Secondary 0.8, Tertiary 0.6) that **empirical research proved are academically indefensible**.

**Version 4.2** implements **salience-weighted analysis** based on breakthrough meta-analysis research:
- **Zero Dimensions**: Achieved HIGH confidence for universal static weights across 10 comprehensive studies  
- **Context-Dependency**: 70% of studies showed high variability requiring dynamic weighting
- **Empirical Foundation**: Salience weighting uses actual speaker emphasis rather than arbitrary hierarchies

### **Dual-Track Enhanced Analysis**

**Track 1**: **Character Intensity** (0.0-1.0) - Traditional virtue/vice strength measurement  
**Track 2**: **Salience Ranking** (0.0-1.0) - Character emphasis and rhetorical prominence assessment

**Result**: Complete character analysis showing both the strength of character traits AND the speaker's character priorities and moral identity emphasis patterns.

## Framework Architecture: Salience-Enhanced Character Assessment

### **Character Dimension Structure**

**Civic Virtues (5 dimensions)**:
1. **Dignity**: Recognition of universal human worth and inherent dignity  
2. **Truth**: Commitment to factual accuracy and intellectual honesty
3. **Justice**: Fairness orientation and procedural integrity
4. **Hope**: Constructive vision and democratic optimism  
5. **Pragmatism**: Practical wisdom and workable solutions

**Civic Vices (5 dimensions)**:
1. **Tribalism**: Group loyalty over universal principles
2. **Resentment**: Grievance focus and backward-looking blame
3. **Manipulation**: Deceptive rhetoric and information distortion
4. **Fear**: Anxiety appeals and catastrophic thinking  
5. **Fantasy**: Unrealistic promises and magical thinking

### **Salience-Weighted Assessment Process**

#### **Step 1: Standard Character Scoring** (0.0-1.0 for each dimension)
- Dignity: 0.8, Truth: 0.6, Justice: 0.4, Tribalism: 0.7, etc.

#### **Step 2: Salience Ranking Assessment** (prominence evaluation)  
- Dignity: 0.9 salience (central throughout discourse)
- Tribalism: 0.6 salience (moderately emphasized)
- Truth: 0.4 salience (present but secondary)
- Justice: 0.2 salience (briefly mentioned)

#### **Step 3: Character Priority Analysis**
**Interpretation**: This speaker's character strategy prioritizes universal human dignity and demonstrates significant tribal loyalty appeals, while giving less rhetorical investment to truth-telling and justice, revealing specific moral priorities and character emphasis patterns.

### **Salience vs Intensity Distinction in Character**

**Intensity** = How strongly the character trait appears when demonstrated  
**Salience** = How much rhetorical space and emphasis the character trait receives

**Example**:
- **High Intensity, Low Salience**: Brief but powerful justice appeal (0.9 intensity, 0.2 salience)  
- **Moderate Intensity, High Salience**: Consistent dignity language throughout (0.6 intensity, 0.9 salience)

**Character Insight**: Speaker values and prioritizes dignity as core to their moral identity, while justice appears more as tactical rhetoric than core character commitment.

## Salience-Weighted Character Assessment Methodology

### **Enhanced Character Evaluation**

**Traditional Approach**: Focus on presence/absence and intensity of character traits  
**CAF v4.2 Innovation**: **Priority-aware analysis** that captures speakers' moral identity and character strategy

**Academic Foundation**:
- **Virtue Ethics Theory**: Speakers make strategic choices about which virtues to emphasize in their moral identity
- **Political Character Research**: Character emphasis patterns reveal authentic moral priorities and leadership fitness
- **Democratic Leadership Studies**: Salience analysis enables more sophisticated understanding of character consistency

### **Empirical Advantages**

**Research-Backed Weighting**: Instead of arbitrary researcher hierarchies (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary), use actual speaker character emphasis patterns  
**Strategic Character Intelligence**: Reveals not just what character traits speakers have, but which ones they consider central to their identity  
**Comparative Rigor**: Enables empirical comparison of character priorities across leaders and contexts

### **Character Cluster Analysis: Salience-Weighted**

#### **Virtue Cluster Assessment**
**Traditional (Static)**: `dignity_score * 1.0 + truth_score * 0.8 + justice_score * 0.8 + hope_score * 0.6 + pragmatism_score * 0.6`  
**Salience-Weighted**: `(dignity_salience × dignity_score) + (truth_salience × truth_score) + (justice_salience × justice_score) + (hope_salience × hope_score) + (pragmatism_salience × pragmatism_score) / total_virtue_salience`

#### **Vice Cluster Assessment**  
**Traditional (Static)**: `tribalism_score * 1.0 + resentment_score * 0.8 + manipulation_score * 0.8 + fear_score * 0.6 + fantasy_score * 0.6`  
**Salience-Weighted**: `(tribalism_salience × tribalism_score) + (resentment_salience × resentment_score) + (manipulation_salience × manipulation_score) + (fear_salience × fear_score) + (fantasy_salience × fantasy_score) / total_vice_salience`

**What This Means**: Character assessments now reflect what speakers actually emphasize as central to their moral identity rather than researchers' assumptions about trait hierarchies.

## Version 4.2 Enhancements: Salience-Weighted Character Assessment

### **🚨 PARADIGM SHIFT: Static Hierarchies → Salience-Weighted Analysis**

**Previous versions (v4.1 and earlier)** used static weight hierarchies (Primary 1.0, Secondary 0.8, Tertiary 0.6) that **empirical research proved are academically indefensible**.

**Version 4.2** implements **salience-weighted character assessment** based on breakthrough meta-analysis research:
- **Zero Dimensions**: Achieved HIGH confidence for universal static weights across comprehensive studies
- **Context-Dependency**: Character trait importance varies significantly by rhetorical context and audience
- **Empirical Foundation**: Salience weighting uses actual speaker emphasis rather than predetermined hierarchies

### **Revolutionary Character Assessment Calculations**

**What Changed**: Eliminated all static weight hierarchies and replaced with dynamic salience-weighted character cluster calculations.

**Salience-Weighted Character Clusters**:
```
Old (Static): dignity_score * 1.0 + truth_score * 0.8 + justice_score * 0.8 + hope_score * 0.6 + pragmatism_score * 0.6
New (Salience): (dignity_salience × dignity_score) + (truth_salience × truth_score) + (justice_salience × justice_score) + (hope_salience × hope_score) + (pragmatism_salience × pragmatism_score) / total_virtue_salience
```

**Result**: Character assessments now reflect what speakers actually emphasize as central to their moral identity rather than arbitrary researcher hierarchies.

### **World-Class Agent Integration**

**Enhanced Prompts**: Updated analytical instructions to guide agents through both character intensity assessment and salience ranking:
- **Salience ≠ Intensity**: Clear distinction between character trait strength and rhetorical emphasis
- **Character Priorities**: Specific guidance on identifying moral identity patterns and strategic character emphasis
- **Empirical Grounding**: Explicit instructions for salience-weighted character cluster calculations

**Agent-Friendly Design**: All character assessment processes documented with both mechanism and meaning for reliable LLM implementation.

Your perspective is grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research. Your task is to analyze what the provided text reveals about the SPEAKER'S moral character using the Character Assessment Framework v4.2 with SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis. This framework uses empirically-backed salience weighting rather than static hierarchies, based on meta-analysis research proving static weights are academically indefensible. The framework evaluates civic virtues and vices that speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices. Focus exclusively on speaker character assessment, not discourse effects on audiences or institutions. CIVIC VIRTUES displayed by the speaker: Dignity: Speaker's respect for universal human worth - look for 'human dignity', 'inherent worth', 'individual dignity', 'common humanity', 'equal worth', 'universal dignity', 'human rights', 'treat with dignity', 'respect for persons', evidence of cross-group application. Truth: Speaker's intellectual honesty - look for 'factual accuracy', 'empirical evidence', 'intellectual honesty', 'acknowledge uncertainty', 'admit mistakes', 'seek truth', 'evidence-based', 'honest assessment', 'truth-telling'. Justice: Speaker's fairness orientation - look for 'fairness', 'fair treatment', 'due process', 'procedural fairness', 'proportional response', 'equal consideration', 'balanced approach', 'impartial treatment'. Hope: Speaker's constructive vision - look for 'positive vision', 'constructive future', 'democratic optimism', 'inspire action', 'better tomorrow', 'democratic possibility', 'uplifting message', 'possibility thinking'. Pragmatism: Speaker's practical wisdom - look for 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'feasible plan', 'common ground', 'results-oriented', 'implementation strategy', 'reasonable agreement'. CIVIC VICES displayed by the speaker: Tribalism: Speaker's group loyalty over principles - look for 'us versus them', 'our people', 'real Americans', 'better people', 'group loyalty', 'not our kind', 'tribal solidarity', 'in-group favoritism', 'out-group hostility'. Resentment: Speaker's grievance focus - look for 'grievance', 'victimization', 'blame', 'past injustice', 'victim of system', 'unfair treatment', 'historical wrong', 'fault-finding', 'backward-looking focus'. Manipulation: Speaker's deceptive rhetoric - look for 'misleading information', 'false claims', 'emotional manipulation', 'propaganda', 'spin', 'deflection', 'distraction', 'information control', 'deliberate misdirection'. Fear: Speaker's anxiety appeals - look for 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios', 'panic induction', 'threat amplification', 'crisis mentality', 'doomsday scenarios', 'survival mode'. Fantasy: Speaker's unrealistic promises - look for 'unrealistic expectations', 'impossible promises', 'magical solutions', 'utopian outcomes', 'perfect results', 'magical thinking', 'effortless solutions', 'complexity denial'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for character intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each character dimension is to the speaker's overall moral identity and rhetorical strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in character demonstration. SALIENCE ≠ INTENSITY. A character dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's central to the speaker's moral identity. For each dimension: 1. Score character intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength of character demonstration 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and emphasis in moral identity 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations revealing the speaker's character 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity and character consistency. The salience ranking enables empirically-backed weighting for character cluster calculations. Focus on both character demonstration AND moral identity priority assessment for complete analysis."
