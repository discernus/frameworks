# Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v7.1
**Version**: 7.1
**Status**: Active
**Major Change**: Enhanced Gasket Schema with Metadata Scores and Advanced Extraction Patterns

---

## Overview

ECF analyzes emotional atmosphere in political discourse through six dimensions, independent of rhetorical strategy, speaker character, or institutional effects. Measures psychological environment that discourse generates.

**Purpose**: Objective measurement of emotional climate for audience response prediction and message optimization.

ECF v7.1 analyzes emotional atmosphere in political discourse through enhanced metadata analysis. Measures psychological environment that discourse generates with advanced extraction patterns and validation rules for robust analysis.

**Innovation**: Salience-weighted analysis captures not just emotional intensity but which emotional dimensions receive the most rhetorical emphasis.

**Applications**: Emotional climate monitoring, audience response prediction, message optimization, cross-context comparison.

## Gasket Architecture

### Raw Analysis Log Format
The analysis agent outputs a raw analysis log containing:
- Emotional climate scores for all 6 dimensions
- Salience weights for each dimension
- Evidence quotes with confidence ratings
- Qualitative reasoning about emotional patterns

### Intelligent Extractor Schema

Your task is to analyze the emotional climate generated by the provided text using the Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v7.1, which measures the psychological environment through six key dimensions with enhanced metadata reporting.\n\nThe framework evaluates emotional climate across six dimensions:\n\n**Fear** (0.0-1.0): Language emphasizing danger, threat, vulnerability, crisis, or existential risk.\n\n**Hope** (0.0-1.0): Language emphasizing positive possibilities, progress, improvement, or achievement potential.\n\n**Enmity** (0.0-1.0): Language creating antagonistic atmosphere toward opponents, enemies, or opposing groups.\n\n**Amity** (0.0-1.0): Language fostering positive relationships, cooperation, solidarity, or shared purpose.\n\n**Envy** (0.0-1.0): Language expressing resentment toward others' advantages, success, or privileged positions.\n\n**Compersion** (0.0-1.0): Language celebrating others' success, merit, achievement, or positive developments.\n\nFor each dimension, provide:\n- **Score (0.0-1.0)**: Based on strength of evidence in the text\n- **Salience (0.0-1.0)**: How central is this dimension to this specific text?\n- **Confidence (0.0-1.0)**: How certain are you in this assessment?\n\nWrite a comprehensive analytical report that covers:\n- Application of the ECF methodology to this specific text\n- Detailed analysis of each relevant dimension with scores, salience, confidence, and evidence\n- Assessment of emotional climate patterns and psychological atmosphere\n- Overall emotional profile with salience weighting\n- Key insights about the emotional environment created by the discourse\n\nEmbed your numerical assessments naturally within the analysis. For example: 'This text demonstrates strong hope climate (hope score: 0.8, salience: 0.9, confidence: 0.7) with frequent references to positive possibilities.' Focus on rigorous intellectual analysis supported by direct textual evidence and clear reasoning for all scores and metadata."
