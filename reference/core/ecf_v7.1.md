# Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v7.1
**Version**: 7.1
**Status**: Active
**Major Change**: Enhanced Gasket Schema with Metadata Scores and Advanced Extraction Patterns

---

## Overview

ECF analyzes emotional atmosphere in political discourse through six dimensions, independent of rhetorical strategy, speaker character, or institutional effects. Measures psychological environment that discourse generates.

**Purpose**: Objective measurement of emotional climate for audience response prediction and message optimization.

ECF v7.1 analyzes emotional atmosphere in political discourse through enhanced metadata analysis. Measures psychological environment that discourse generates with advanced extraction patterns and validation rules for robust analysis.

**Innovation**: Salience-weighted analysis captures not just emotional intensity but which emotional dimensions receive the most rhetorical emphasis.

**Applications**: Emotional climate monitoring, audience response prediction, message optimization, cross-context comparison.

## Gasket Architecture

### Raw Analysis Log Format
The analysis agent outputs a raw analysis log containing:
- Emotional climate scores for all 6 dimensions
- Salience weights for each dimension
- Evidence quotes with confidence ratings
- Qualitative reasoning about emotional patterns

### Intelligent Extractor Schema
```json
{
  "gasket_schema": {
    "target_keys": [

Phase 2: Framework Methodology: Your task is to analyze the emotional climate generated by the provided text using the Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v7.1, which measures the psychological environment through six key dimensions. Phase 3: Operational Definitions: Evaluate six dimensions: Fear (crisis/threat climate), Hope (opportunity/progress climate), Enmity (hostility/conflict climate), Amity (friendship/unity climate), Envy (resentment/grievance climate), and Compersion (celebration/merit climate). Each dimension receives a score (0.0-1.0), salience weight (0.0-1.0), and confidence rating (0.0-1.0). Phase 4: Scoring Protocol: For each dimension, provide ONLY: (1) score (0.0-1.0), (2) salience (0.0-1.0), (3) confidence (0.0-1.0), (4) evidence quotes with justification. Phase 5: Raw Analysis Log Requirements: Your response must be a raw analysis log containing dimensional scores, evidence, and reasoning - NO JSON structure or derived calculations. Phase 6: Output Specification: Return raw analysis log with dimensional scores only - NO calculations of polarity or derived metrics (these will be computed by code)."
