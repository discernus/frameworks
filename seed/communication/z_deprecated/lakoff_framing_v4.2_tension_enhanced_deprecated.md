## Lakoff Framing Framework Core Analysis

*[Preserving all existing Lakoff v4.1 functionality with tension enhancement]*

### **Three Bipolar Dimensions: Family Model Architecture**

**1. Authority vs Empathy**
- **Strict Father (1.0)**: Strong leadership, moral authority, decisive action
- **Nurturant Parent (0.0)**: Understanding, inclusive dialogue, listening to voices

**2. Competition vs Cooperation**  
- **Strict Father (1.0)**: Natural hierarchy, merit-based systems, individual achievement
- **Nurturant Parent (0.0)**: Working together, shared responsibility, collaborative approaches

**3. Self-Reliance vs Interdependence**
- **Strict Father (1.0)**: Personal responsibility, self-reliance, bootstrap philosophy  
- **Nurturant Parent (0.0)**: Stronger together, mutual dependence, common good emphasis

## Revolutionary Family Model Tension Mathematics (v4.2 Enhancement)

### **Family Model Tension Scoring**

**Formula**: `Family Model Tension = min(Strict_Father_score, Nurturant_Parent_score) Ã— |Strict_Father_salience - Nurturant_Parent_salience|`

**Note**: Since Lakoff dimensions are bipolar (0.0-1.0 scale where 1.0 = Strict Father, 0.0 = Nurturant Parent), tension calculation uses:
- **Strict Father Score** = Dimension score (0.0-1.0)
- **Nurturant Parent Score** = (1.0 - Dimension score) for each dimension

**Lakoff Family Model Tension Pairs**:
1. **Authority-Empathy Tension**: `min(authority_score, (1.0 - authority_score)) Ã— |authority_salience - (1.0 - authority_salience)|`
2. **Competition-Cooperation Tension**: `min(competition_score, (1.0 - competition_score)) Ã— |competition_salience - (1.0 - competition_salience)|`  
3. **Self-Reliance-Interdependence Tension**: `min(self_reliance_score, (1.0 - self_reliance_score)) Ã— |self_reliance_salience - (1.0 - self_reliance_salience)|`

### **Family Model Strategic Contradiction Index (FMSCI)**

**Formula**: `FMSCI = (Sum of all Family Model Tension Scores) / Number of Dimensions`

```
FMSCI = (Authority_Empathy_Tension + Competition_Cooperation_Tension + Self_Reliance_Interdependence_Tension) / 3
```

### **Family Model Tension Pattern Classification**

**FMSCI Family Model Coherence Assessment**:
- **0.00-0.15**: **Moral Framework Coherence** - Consistent family model across all dimensions
- **0.16-0.30**: **Moral Framework Complexity** - Moderate tensions with sophisticated family model integration
- **0.31-0.45**: **Moral Framework Ambivalence** - Significant family model contradictions requiring interpretation  
- **0.46+**: **Moral Framework Contradiction** - High tension from incompatible family model elements

### **Advanced Family Model Analytics**

**Family Model Salience Concentration**: `FMSC = Standard Deviation of Family Model Dimension Salience Scores`
- **Focused Moral Framework** (FMSC > 0.3): Clear family model dimensional priorities
- **Distributed Moral Framework** (FMSC < 0.2): Broad engagement across family model dimensions

**Family Model Tension-Salience Interaction Effects**:
- **High Framework Focus + Low FMSCI**: Authentic moral framework with clear family model priorities
- **High Framework Focus + High FMSCI**: Moral framework confusion with competing family model emphases  
- **Low Framework Focus + Low FMSCI**: Sophisticated moral complexity with coherent family model integration
- **Low Framework Focus + High FMSCI**: Inconsistent family model reasoning across moral contexts

### **Family Model Strategic Architecture Analysis**

**Strict Father vs Nurturant Parent Coherence**:
- **Strict Father Coherence**: High authority, competition, self-reliance with low tensions
- **Nurturant Parent Coherence**: High empathy, cooperation, interdependence with low tensions
- **Mixed Framework**: Moderate tensions from balancing both family model elements

**Dimensional Priority Analysis**:
- **Authority-Empathy Priority**: Which family model element receives most rhetorical investment
- **Competition-Cooperation Balance**: Strategic choices about individual vs collective emphasis
- **Self-Reliance-Interdependence Framework**: Personal responsibility vs mutual dependence priority

## Enhanced Family Model Agent Integration

### **Family-Model-Tension-Aware Analysis Instructions**

**Critical Enhancement**: Agents now assess both traditional family model patterns AND moral framework contradiction patterns:

1. **Standard Family Model Scoring**: Dimension position (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) assessment for 3 bipolar dimensions
2. **Family Model Tension Calculation**: Automated computation of 3 family model tension scores  
3. **FMSCI Assessment**: Family Model Strategic Contradiction Index with coherence classification
4. **Moral Framework Analysis**: Salience concentration effects on family model reasoning consistency

**Agent Prompt Enhancement**: *"After completing traditional Lakoff family model analysis, calculate family model tensions for all 3 bipolar dimensions. For each dimension, use min(score, 1.0-score) Ã— |salience_difference| to measure internal coherence tensions. Compute the Family Model Strategic Contradiction Index as the average of all tension scores. Assess whether the speaker demonstrates coherent family model reasoning or exhibits moral framework contradictions."*

This enhancement enables systematic analysis of moral framework coherence - revealing whether speakers demonstrate consistent family model reasoning or exhibit measurable contradictions in their moral framework priorities.

**Key Innovation**: Lakoff v4.2 transforms family model analysis from measuring **which family model speakers prefer** to measuring **how coherently they apply family model reasoning**, providing unprecedented insight into moral framework authenticity and reasoning consistency.

**Research Foundation**: Built on validated tension mathematics from Issue #125, providing empirical foundation for cognitive linguistics research and moral framework assessment.

**Political Applications**: Enables systematic evaluation of moral framework coherence in political discourse, revealing authentic family model identity vs tactical moral positioning.
