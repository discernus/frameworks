# Lakoff Framing Framework (LFF) v4.0
## Family Model Political Communication Analysis

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Lakoff Framing Framework (LFF) analyzes political discourse through George Lakoff's family model theory, examining how Strict Father and Nurturant Parent moral systems manifest in political communication. This framework tests Lakoff's coherence hypothesis that political worldviews stem from consistent family models that generate predictable positions across issues.

**Core Purpose**: LFF reveals whether political communications follow family model clustering patterns, testing cognitive linguistics theory through systematic analysis of authority versus empathy orientations in political discourse.

**Key Applications**:
- **Family Model Coherence Testing**: Validate Lakoff's clustering hypothesis empirically
- **Political Psychology Research**: Analyze cognitive moral frameworks in communication
- **Message Strategy Analysis**: Understand family model consistency in political messaging
- **Cross-Issue Prediction**: Test whether family model positions predict stances on new issues

## Theoretical Foundation

### Lakoff's Family Model Theory

Drawing from George Lakoff's groundbreaking work "Moral Politics," this framework examines how family structures serve as unconscious models for political thinking. Lakoff argues that political worldviews stem from two fundamental family models that shape moral reasoning.

**Core Innovation**: Politics as extension of family moral systems, where metaphorical family structures determine political positions across diverse policy domains.

### Strict Father Model

**Theoretical Grounding**: Politics as extension of strict father family structure emphasizing moral authority, competitive achievement, and individual responsibility.

**Cognitive Framework**: Strong moral authority provides clear discipline and guidance; competition builds character and determines merit; individuals must be self-reliant and personally accountable.

### Nurturant Parent Model  

**Theoretical Grounding**: Politics as extension of nurturant parent family structure emphasizing empathetic care, cooperative support, and collective responsibility.

**Cognitive Framework**: Empathetic understanding guides inclusive dialogue; cooperation creates mutual support and shared problem-solving; interdependence recognizes collective responsibility for well-being.

### Family Model Coherence Hypothesis

**Lakoff's Prediction**: Political communications should cluster around coherent family models, with Strict Father components appearing together and competing with Nurturant Parent components.

**Empirical Test**: If family models truly organize political thinking, we should observe:
- Component clustering within each family model
- Competitive relationships between family models  
- Predictive consistency across political issues
- Coherence violations indicating strategic messaging

**Nurturant Parent (Cooperation/Mutual Support)**: Egalitarian cooperation, shared responsibility, collective problem-solving

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Cooperation Language**:
- "working together," "shared responsibility," "collective effort," "mutual support," "help each other"
- "community strength," "collaboration," "partnership," "united approach," "team effort"

#### Self-Reliance vs Interdependence (0.0-1.0 bipolar)

**Strict Father (Self-Reliance)**: Individual responsibility, self-determination, personal accountability for outcomes

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Self-Reliance Language**:
- "personal responsibility," "self-reliance," "individual accountability," "pull yourself up," "earn your way"
- "stand on your own," "personal choice," "individual freedom," "self-determination," "bootstrap"
- "self-made," "independent," "personal agency," "individual merit," "self-sufficiency"

**Nurturant Parent (Interdependence)**: Collective responsibility, social connection, mutual dependence as foundation

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Interdependence Language**:
- "we're all connected," "stronger together," "collective well-being," "mutual dependence," "shared fate"
- "common good," "social fabric," "community bonds," "interconnected society," "mutual obligation"
- "collective responsibility," "shared prosperity," "social solidarity," "community interdependence"

## Family Model Coherence Analysis

### Mathematical Specifications

**Strict Father Model Score**:
`(authority_score + competition_score + self_reliance_score) / 3`

**Nurturant Parent Model Score**:
`(empathy_score + cooperation_score + interdependence_score) / 3`

**Family Model Coherence Index**: 
`|strict_father_model_score - nurturant_parent_model_score|`

**Family Model Dominance**: 
`strict_father_model_score - nurturant_parent_model_score`

**Range**: -1.0 (fully Nurturant Parent) to +1.0 (fully Strict Father)

### Coherence Validation Metrics

**Component Clustering Assessment**: How closely related family model components appear together in discourse

**Cross-Model Competition**: Evidence of competitive relationships between Strict Father and Nurturant Parent components

**Coherence Violations**: Mixed messaging that violates family model predictions (high scores on opposing components)

**Predictive Consistency**: Whether family model positioning predicts stances on related issues

### Pattern Analysis

**High Coherence Pattern**: Strong clustering within one family model with minimal cross-model activation

**Mixed Messaging Pattern**: Significant activation of both family models indicating strategic communication or cognitive inconsistency

**Competitive Dynamics**: Evidence of family models competing for cognitive dominance in discourse

## Integration Applications

### Political Psychology Research

**Cognitive Consistency Testing**: Validate whether politicians maintain family model coherence across issues

**Voter Response Analysis**: Examine how family model coherence affects audience reception and persuasion

**Cross-Issue Prediction**: Test whether family model positions predict unknown political stances

### Communication Strategy Analysis

**Message Coherence Assessment**: Evaluate strategic consistency in political messaging

**Audience Targeting**: Understand how family model appeals connect with different voter segments

**Opposition Research**: Analyze competing family model frameworks in political debates

### Temporal and Cultural Studies

**Historical Family Model Evolution**: Track changes in family model prominence over time

**Cross-Cultural Validation**: Test family model universality across different cultural contexts

**Generational Analysis**: Examine family model transmission and evolution across generations

## Quality Standards and Disambiguation

### Evidence Requirements

**Direct Quotations**: 2+ supporting quotations per dimension scored above 0.3
**Confidence Ratings**: 0.0-1.0 assessment of evidence clarity and theoretical alignment
**Clustering Documentation**: Clear identification of family model component relationships
**Coherence Assessment**: Analysis of whether components cluster as predicted by theory

### Analytical Guidelines

**Independent Bipolar Scoring**: Each dimension assessed separately on bipolar scale (Strict Father to Nurturant Parent)
**Component Relationship Analysis**: Attention to how family model components relate and compete
**Coherence Testing**: Systematic evaluation of clustering hypothesis predictions
**Cultural Context Sensitivity**: Family model expressions evaluated within appropriate cultural framework

### Disambiguation Strategies

**Authority vs Authoritarianism**: Authority/discipline (family model) distinct from authoritarian governance (political system)

**Competition vs Conflict**: Merit-based competition (family model) distinct from hostile conflict (emotional climate)

**Empathy vs Weakness**: Empathetic understanding (family model) distinct from political weakness (strategic assessment)

**Individual vs Selfish**: Self-reliance (family model) distinct from selfish behavior (character assessment)
