# Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) v4.1 - Salience Enhanced
## Independent Moral Foundation Assessment with Salience-Weighted Analysis

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) v4.1 analyzes moral reasoning patterns in political discourse through **salience-enhanced moral foundation assessment**, based on Jonathan Haidt's comprehensive model of human moral psychology. This framework evaluates moral appeals through independent foundation scoring across six foundation pairs, **weighted by actual rhetorical emphasis patterns** rather than predetermined assumptions about moral foundation importance.

**Core Purpose**: MFT reveals how speakers use moral reasoning in political communication by measuring both the presence and rhetorical prominence of moral foundations, enabling understanding of moral strategy and authentic moral priorities in discourse.

**Version 4.1 Innovation**: **Salience-weighted moral analysis** - analyzes not just which moral foundations are present, but which moral dimensions speakers emphasize most in their moral reasoning strategy, enabling empirically-grounded assessment of moral discourse priorities.

**Key Applications**:
- **Moral Strategy Analysis**: Understand which moral foundations speakers prioritize in their rhetorical approach
- **Cross-Ideological Research**: Compare moral emphasis patterns across progressive, conservative, and libertarian discourse
- **Moral Psychology Research**: Study relationships between moral salience patterns and political effectiveness
- **Authentic Moral Assessment**: Evaluate moral consistency using empirically-backed foundation weighting

## What is Salience-Enhanced Moral Foundation Analysis?

### **Salience in Moral Reasoning**

**Salience** = How much rhetorical emphasis the speaker places on each moral foundation, regardless of raw foundation intensity scores.

**Key Insight**: A speaker might demonstrate moderate Care Foundation appeals (0.6 intensity) consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly invoking intense Authority Foundation language (1.0 intensity) in one section. The Care Foundation has much higher **salience** (0.8) than Authority (0.2) despite lower raw intensity.

**Why This Matters for Moral Foundation Analysis**:
- **Moral Priorities**: Reveals which moral foundations speakers prioritize in their moral identity and reasoning
- **Strategic Moral Communication**: Shows which moral foundations speakers invest the most rhetorical effort in emphasizing
- **Authentic Moral Assessment**: Uses actual moral emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about foundation importance

### **Enhanced Moral Intelligence**

**Traditional Approach**: Focus on presence/absence and intensity of moral foundation patterns  
**MFT v4.1 Innovation**: **Priority-aware analysis** that captures speakers' moral strategy and foundation priorities

**Academic Foundation**:
- **Moral Psychology Theory**: Speakers make strategic choices about which moral foundations to emphasize in their moral reasoning
- **Political Communication Research**: Moral emphasis patterns reveal authentic moral priorities and persuasion strategies
- **Moral Foundation Studies**: Salience analysis enables more sophisticated understanding of moral reasoning variations

### **Dual-Track Moral Analysis**

**Track 1**: **Moral Foundation Intensity** (0.0-1.0) - Traditional foundation strength measurement across 12 foundations  
**Track 2**: **Salience Ranking** (0.0-1.0) - Moral foundation emphasis and rhetorical prominence assessment

**Result**: Complete moral analysis showing both the strength of moral foundation appeals AND the speaker's moral priorities and strategic emphasis patterns in moral reasoning.

## Framework Architecture: Salience-Enhanced Moral Foundation Assessment

### **Six Foundation Pairs: Independent Scoring**

**Individualizing Foundations**:
1. **Care vs Harm**: Compassion/protection vs suffering/cruelty prevention
2. **Fairness vs Cheating**: Justice/proportionality vs unfairness/exploitation

**Binding Foundations**:
3. **Loyalty vs Betrayal**: Group cohesion/fidelity vs group abandonment/treachery  
4. **Authority vs Subversion**: Hierarchy/respect vs tradition undermining/rebellion
5. **Sanctity vs Degradation**: Sacred/pure vs profane/contamination

**Liberty Foundation**:
6. **Liberty vs Oppression**: Freedom/autonomy vs control/domination

### **Salience-Enhanced Assessment Process**

#### **Step 1: Standard Moral Foundation Scoring** (0.0-1.0 for each foundation)
- Care: 0.7, Authority: 0.5, Liberty: 0.6, Fairness: 0.4, etc.

#### **Step 2: Salience Ranking Assessment** (prominence evaluation)  
- Care: 0.9 salience (emphasized throughout discourse as central moral concern)
- Liberty: 0.6 salience (moderately emphasized)
- Authority: 0.3 salience (briefly mentioned)
- Fairness: 0.2 salience (minimal rhetorical emphasis)

#### **Step 3: Moral Priority Analysis**
**Interpretation**: This speaker's moral strategy prioritizes Care Foundation as central to their moral reasoning and demonstrates moderate Liberty Foundation emphasis, while giving less rhetorical investment to Authority and Fairness, revealing specific moral priorities and foundation emphasis patterns.

### **Salience vs Intensity Distinction in Moral Reasoning**

**Intensity** = How strongly the moral foundation appears when demonstrated  
**Salience** = How much rhetorical space and emphasis the moral foundation receives

**Example**:
- **High Intensity, Low Salience**: Brief but intense authority appeal (0.9 intensity, 0.2 salience)  
- **Moderate Intensity, High Salience**: Consistent care language throughout (0.6 intensity, 0.9 salience)

**Moral Insight**: Speaker values and prioritizes care as central to their moral identity and reasoning strategy, while authority appears more as tactical rhetoric than core moral commitment.

Your approach is grounded in Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory and empirical research on moral intuitions across cultures. Your task is to analyze the provided text using Moral Foundations Theory v4.1 with SALIENCE-ENHANCED analysis. This framework uses empirically-backed salience weighting rather than traditional binary approaches, examining moral discourse through independent foundation scoring across six foundation pairs. The framework evaluates moral appeals through both intensity and prominence measurement. CRITICAL: You must assess both INTENSITY (how strong each foundation is) and SALIENCE (how rhetorically prominent each foundation is) for all 12 foundations. MORAL FOUNDATIONS: Care Foundation: Compassion/protection orientation - look for 'protect', 'defend', 'compassion', 'kindness', 'care', 'concern', 'suffering', 'pain', 'vulnerable', 'prevent harm', 'reduce suffering'. Harm Foundation: Suffering/cruelty concern - look for 'harm', 'hurt', 'damage', 'violence', 'brutality', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'victims', 'innocent', 'defenseless'. Fairness Foundation: Justice/proportional treatment - look for 'fair', 'just', 'equitable', 'equal', 'rights', 'deserve', 'earned', 'equality', 'proportional', 'appropriate'. Cheating Foundation: Unfairness/exploitation concern - look for 'unfair', 'unjust', 'biased', 'exploit', 'cheat', 'corrupt', 'rigged', 'discriminated against', 'denied justice'. Loyalty Foundation: Group cohesion/fidelity - look for 'loyalty', 'solidarity', 'unity', 'our group', 'our people', 'defend our group', 'stand together', 'proud of', 'honor our group'. Betrayal Foundation: Group abandonment/treachery - look for 'betray', 'abandon', 'desert', 'disloyal', 'traitorous', 'turn their back', 'broken trust', 'let us down'. Authority Foundation: Hierarchy/tradition respect - look for 'authority', 'leadership', 'tradition', 'custom', 'order', 'discipline', 'respect authority', 'established way', 'institutions'. Subversion Foundation: Authority undermining/rebellion - look for 'challenge authority', 'resist control', 'corrupt institutions', 'revolution', 'overthrow', 'anti-establishment', 'abuse of power'. Sanctity Foundation: Sacred/pure emphasis - look for 'sacred', 'holy', 'pure', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'noble', 'virtuous', 'higher purpose', 'transcendent'. Degradation Foundation: Profane/contamination concern - look for 'contaminated', 'corrupted', 'tainted', 'decay', 'degeneration', 'disgusting', 'revolting', 'moral rot'. Liberty Foundation: Freedom/autonomy emphasis - look for 'freedom', 'liberty', 'independent', 'individual rights', 'personal freedom', 'self-governance', 'limited government'. Oppression Foundation: Control/domination concern - look for 'control', 'dominate', 'oppress', 'government overreach', 'tyranny', 'loss of freedom', 'coercion', 'force'. CRITICAL: After scoring all foundations for intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each moral foundation is to the overall moral reasoning strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence. SALIENCE ≠ INTENSITY. A foundation can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's central to the moral reasoning throughout the discourse. For each foundation: 1. Score intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on foundation strength and frequency 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and moral reasoning emphasis 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations supporting your assessment 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity. The salience ranking enables empirically-backed understanding of moral strategy and foundation priorities. Focus on moral reasoning patterns and strategic moral communication priorities revealed through salience analysis."
