# Moral Foundations Theory v4.0
## Independent Foundation Scoring for Comprehensive Moral Psychology Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

The Moral Foundations Theory v4.0 applies Haidt's moral foundations principles to political discourse analysis through computational methods. By scoring each moral foundation separately (0.0 to 1.0) rather than using bipolar relationships, this framework captures sophisticated moral patterns including moral complexity, strategic balance, and moral disengagement in political texts.

**Core Approach**: Independent foundation scoring preserves complete moral foundation information, enabling detection of nuanced moral reasoning patterns in political discourse.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Moral Complexity Detection**: High Care + High Authority = sophisticated moral reasoning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of pure directional, moral complexity, disengaged, and strategic balance patterns
- **Rich Evidence Base**: Two quotations per foundation with confidence ratings
- **Political Psychology Insights**: Liberal vs conservative moral foundation usage patterns
- **Scalable Analysis**: Optimized for large-scale political discourse evaluation

## Part 1: Theoretical Foundation

### The Computational Scoring Challenge

**Haidt's Research Focus**: MFT primarily uses self-report questionnaires (MFQ-30, MFQ-2) for individual moral psychology assessment, not computational text analysis.

**Our Computational Extension**: This framework extends MFT principles to political discourse analysis through computational methods we've developed.

### Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory

Based on Jonathan Haidt's research identifying six innate psychological foundations that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. These foundations evolved to address adaptive challenges faced by humans living in groups, providing the psychological basis for moral intuitions across cultures.

**Six Foundation Pairs with Twelve Independent Anchors**:

1. **Care-Harm Foundation**: Evolved from mammalian attachment and empathy systems
2. **Fairness-Cheating Foundation**: Evolved from reciprocal altruism and cooperation
3. **Loyalty-Betrayal Foundation**: Evolved from group cooperation and tribal solidarity
4. **Authority-Subversion Foundation**: Evolved from primate hierarchical social structures
5. **Sanctity-Degradation Foundation**: Evolved from disgust psychology and contamination avoidance
6. **Liberty-Oppression Foundation**: Evolved from resistance to domination and coercion

### Three-Stage Normative Layering

**Stage 1: Individual Foundation Analysis** - Independent scoring of all 12 moral foundations
**Stage 2: Foundation Pair Analysis** - Six bipolar moral tensions and competitive patterns
**Stage 3: Category Analysis** - Individualizing vs Binding vs Liberty moral orientations

## Part 2: Independent Foundation Methodology

### Foundation Scoring Protocol

**Scale Definition**: Each foundation scored independently from 0.0 to 1.0
- **0.0-0.2**: Minimal to no moral foundation evidence
- **0.3-0.4**: Weak foundation presence with limited evidence
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate foundation presence with clear evidence
- **0.7-0.8**: Strong foundation presence with substantial evidence
- **0.9-1.0**: Dominant foundation presence with overwhelming evidence

**Evidence Requirements**:
- **Goal**: Approximately 2 direct quotations per foundation
- **Flexibility**: Adjust based on text content and moral evidence availability
- **Quality Focus**: Strong moral reasoning evidence preferred over quotation quantity
- **Confidence Rating**: 0.0-1.0 based on evidence clarity and interpretive certainty

### Moral Pattern Recognition

**Four Primary Moral Patterns**:

**Pure Directional**: High score on one foundation, low on its pair
- Indicates clear, unified moral positioning
- Example: Care=0.8, Harm=0.1 (strong care-based moral reasoning)

**Moral Complexity**: High scores on both foundations in a pair
- Indicates sophisticated moral reasoning managing competing moral claims
- Example: Care=0.7, Authority=0.8 (balancing compassion with order)

**Morally Disengaged**: Low scores on both foundations in a pair
- Indicates minimal engagement with this moral domain
- Example: Sanctity=0.2, Degradation=0.1 (moral purity not relevant)

**Strategic Moral Balance**: Moderate scores with clear directional preference
- Indicates measured moral positioning and strategic restraint
- Example: Fairness=0.6, Cheating=0.2 (moderate justice emphasis)

### Political Psychology Insights

**Liberal Moral Profile**: High individualizing foundations (Care, Fairness), lower binding foundations
**Conservative Moral Profile**: More balanced usage across all foundations
**Libertarian Moral Profile**: High Liberty foundation, variable on others

Your approach is grounded in Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory and empirical research on moral intuitions across cultures. Your task is to analyze the provided text using Moral Foundations Theory v4.0. This framework examines moral discourse through independent foundation scoring across six foundation pairs, capturing moral complexity that traditional bipolar scoring obscures. First, classify the political worldview of the text. The valid options are \"Progressive\", \"Conservative\", \"Libertarian\", or \"Other\". Then evaluate all 12 moral foundations across 6 foundation pairs using the linguistic markers provided. For each foundation, follow this process: 1. Read the text systematically for linguistic markers associated with that specific moral foundation 2. Consider lexical evidence, semantic patterns, and moral reasoning strategies 3. Score the foundation independently from 0.0 to 1.0 based on strength, frequency, and strategic importance of evidence 4. Assess your confidence in the scoring based on evidence clarity and quantity 5. Aim to provide approximately 2 direct quotations supporting each foundation score. Remember: Score each foundation independently. A text can score high on both Care and Authority, or low on both, or any combination. The goal is to capture the complete moral reasoning landscape without forcing artificial bipolar relationships."
