## What is Salience-Enhanced Worldview Analysis?

### **Salience in Political Legitimacy**

**Salience** = How much rhetorical emphasis the speaker places on each worldview legitimacy source, regardless of raw worldview intensity scores.

**Key Insight**: A speaker might demonstrate moderate Pluralist Individual Dignity appeals (0.6 intensity) consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly invoking intense Tribal Domination language (1.0 intensity) in one section. The Pluralist Dignity has much higher **salience** (0.8) than Tribal Domination (0.2) despite lower raw intensity.

**Why This Matters for Political Worldview Analysis**:
- **Political Priorities**: Reveals which legitimacy sources speakers prioritize in their political identity and reasoning
- **Strategic Political Communication**: Shows which worldview sources speakers invest the most rhetorical effort in emphasizing
- **Authentic Political Assessment**: Uses actual worldview emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about legitimacy importance

### **Enhanced Political Intelligence**

**Traditional Approach**: Focus on presence/absence and intensity of worldview legitimacy patterns  
**v4.1 Innovation**: **Priority-aware analysis** that captures speakers' political strategy and worldview priorities

**Academic Foundation**:
- **Political Theory**: Speakers make strategic choices about which legitimacy sources to emphasize in their political reasoning
- **Political Communication Research**: Worldview emphasis patterns reveal authentic political priorities and persuasion strategies
- **Democratic Studies**: Salience analysis enables more sophisticated understanding of political legitimacy variations

### **Dual-Track Political Analysis**

**Track 1**: **Worldview Intensity** (0.0-1.0) - Traditional legitimacy source strength measurement across 3 dimensions  
**Track 2**: **Salience Ranking** (0.0-1.0) - Worldview emphasis and rhetorical prominence assessment

**Result**: Complete political analysis showing both the strength of legitimacy appeals AND the speaker's political priorities and strategic emphasis patterns in worldview positioning.

## Framework Architecture: Salience-Enhanced Worldview Assessment

### **Three Sources of Political Legitimacy: Enhanced Analysis**

**1. Immutable-Identity Politics (Crenshaw) (0.0-1.0)**  
Drawing from intersectionality theory - political legitimacy centered on overlapping, unchosen personal attributes

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Identity-Based Claims**: "as a [identity group]," "lived experience," "identity shapes perspective," "group-based understanding"
- **Intersectionality Language**: "intersectional," "multiple identities," "overlapping systems," "identity intersection," "compound identity"
- **Experience Authority**: "my experience," "our community knows," "identity-based knowledge," "lived reality," "group perspective"
- **Identity Politics**: "identity matters," "representation counts," "diverse voices," "identity-conscious," "group-specific needs"

**2. Tribal Domination (Machiavelli) (0.0-1.0)**  
Rooted in realist political theory - legitimacy through in-group supremacy and security in zero-sum competition

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:  
- **Group Supremacy**: "our group first," "our people," "our interests," "group priority," "in-group advantage"
- **Zero-Sum Competition**: "us vs them," "win or lose," "dominate," "victory," "defeat them," "supremacy," "group survival"
- **Tribal Security**: "protect our group," "group defense," "tribal loyalty," "group strength," "collective power"
- **Dominance Language**: "control," "power," "dominance," "superiority," "group hegemony," "tribal victory"

**3. Pluralist Individual Dignity (Kant) (0.0-1.0)**  
Based on liberal dignity theory - legitimacy through transcendent dignity and agency of each person

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Universal Dignity**: "human dignity," "individual worth," "personal dignity," "inherent value," "equal dignity"
- **Individual Agency**: "personal choice," "individual freedom," "autonomous decision," "self-determination," "personal agency"
- **Pluralist Equality**: "equal respect," "civic equality," "universal principles," "equal treatment," "shared humanity"
- **Transcendent Values**: "universal values," "transcendent dignity," "common humanity," "moral equality," "inherent rights"

### **Salience-Enhanced Assessment Process**

#### **Step 1: Standard Worldview Scoring** (0.0-1.0 for each dimension)
- Immutable-Identity: 0.6, Tribal Domination: 0.3, Pluralist Dignity: 0.8

#### **Step 2: Salience Ranking Assessment** (prominence evaluation)  
- Pluralist Dignity: 0.9 salience (emphasized throughout as central political philosophy)
- Immutable-Identity: 0.4 salience (moderately emphasized)
- Tribal Domination: 0.2 salience (briefly mentioned)

#### **Step 3: Political Priority Analysis**
**Interpretation**: This speaker's political strategy prioritizes Pluralist Individual Dignity as central to their political legitimacy and demonstrates moderate Identity Politics emphasis, while giving minimal rhetorical investment to Tribal Domination, revealing specific political worldview priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.

### **Salience vs Intensity Distinction in Political Worldview**

**Intensity** = How strongly the worldview legitimacy source appears when demonstrated  
**Salience** = How much rhetorical space and emphasis the worldview source receives

**Example**:
- **High Intensity, Low Salience**: Brief but intense tribal domination appeal (0.9 intensity, 0.2 salience)  
- **Moderate Intensity, High Salience**: Consistent pluralist dignity language throughout (0.6 intensity, 0.9 salience)

**Political Insight**: Speaker values and prioritizes universal dignity as central to their political identity and legitimacy strategy, while tribal appeals appear more as tactical rhetoric than core political commitment.

## Competitive Dynamics: Salience-Weighted Analysis

### **Traditional Worldview Tensions Enhanced**
- **Identity vs. Dignity**: Tension between group-based claims and universal principles (now weighted by salience)
- **Domination vs. Dignity**: Conflict between supremacist and egalitarian visions (prominence-aware analysis)  
- **Identity vs. Domination**: Competition between different forms of group-based politics (strategic emphasis analysis)

### **Salience-Weighted Strategic Positioning**
- **Worldview Dominance**: Which legitimacy source receives highest rhetorical investment
- **Strategic Worldview Balance**: How speakers allocate emphasis across legitimacy sources
- **Tactical vs Core Commitments**: Distinction between brief appeals and sustained worldview emphasis

## Version 4.1 Enhancements: Salience Integration

### **New Capabilities Added**
- **Salience Ranking System**: Complete rhetorical prominence assessment for all 3 worldview dimensions
- **Political Strategy Analysis**: Understanding of speakers' political priorities and strategic emphasis patterns
- **Enhanced Worldview Intelligence**: Empirical comparison of legitimacy source emphasis across speakers/contexts
- **Research-Backed Assessment**: Use salience data for empirically-informed political worldview evaluation

### **Maintained Core Strengths**  
- **Triadic Independence**: Preserved sophisticated 3-dimension analysis avoiding artificial bipolar constraints
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Maintained detection of worldview conflicts and strategic positioning
- **Theoretical Integration**: Enhanced rather than compromised intersectionality/realist/liberal dignity foundation
- **Political Precision**: Preserved ability to identify pure, hybrid, and transitional worldview patterns

### **World-Class Agent Integration**

Your approach is grounded in intersectionality theory, realist political theory, and liberal dignity theory. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Political Worldview Triad Framework v4.1 with SALIENCE-ENHANCED analysis. This framework uses empirically-backed salience weighting to examine political discourse through three distinct legitimacy sources, evaluating both intensity and prominence of worldview appeals. CRITICAL: You must assess both INTENSITY (how strong each worldview is) and SALIENCE (how rhetorically prominent each worldview is) for all 3 dimensions. POLITICAL WORLDVIEW DIMENSIONS: Immutable-Identity Politics: Identity-centered legitimacy - look for 'as a [identity group]', 'lived experience', 'identity shapes perspective', 'intersectional', 'multiple identities', 'my experience', 'our community knows', 'identity matters', 'representation counts', 'diverse voices', 'group-specific needs'. Tribal Domination: Group supremacy legitimacy - look for 'our group first', 'our people', 'us vs them', 'win or lose', 'dominate', 'victory', 'protect our group', 'group defense', 'tribal loyalty', 'control', 'power', 'superiority', 'group hegemony'. Pluralist Individual Dignity: Universal dignity legitimacy - look for 'human dignity', 'individual worth', 'personal dignity', 'inherent value', 'personal choice', 'individual freedom', 'self-determination', 'equal respect', 'civic equality', 'universal principles', 'transcendent dignity', 'common humanity'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each worldview dimension is to the overall political legitimacy strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence. SALIENCE ≠ INTENSITY. A dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's central to the political reasoning throughout the discourse. For each dimension: 1. Score intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on worldview strength and frequency 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and political emphasis 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations supporting your assessment 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity. The salience ranking enables empirically-backed understanding of political strategy and worldview priorities. Focus on political legitimacy patterns and strategic political communication priorities revealed through salience analysis."
