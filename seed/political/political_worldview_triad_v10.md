# Political Worldview Triad Framework v10.0

## Abstract & Raison d'ÃŠtre

The Political Worldview Triad Framework v10.0 provides a sophisticated analytical lens for examining the fundamental competing sources of political legitimacy that shape contemporary democratic discourse. This framework identifies and analyzes three distinct legitimacy paradigms: **Identity-Based Legitimacy** (immutable-identity politics), **Dominance-Based Legitimacy** (tribal domination), and **Universal Dignity Legitimacy** (pluralist individual dignity).

**Theoretical Foundation**: Grounded in political theory and democratic legitimacy research, this framework captures the essential value structures that drive political communication and moral authority claims. It enables researchers to systematically analyze how texts appeal to different sources of political legitimacy and reveals the underlying worldview assumptions that shape political discourse.

**Innovation**: The triadic analysis approach provides a comprehensive measurement of competing legitimacy sources, enabling nuanced empirical data about political communication patterns beyond simple left-right dichotomies. The framework's emphasis on legitimacy sources rather than policy positions allows for cross-cultural and cross-temporal analysis of political discourse.

**Applications**: Political legitimacy analysis, democratic discourse assessment, comparative political communication studies, worldview mapping in political texts, moral authority analysis, and political psychology research.

## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

The Political Worldview Triad Framework builds upon established research in political theory, democratic legitimacy, and political psychology. The framework's theoretical foundation draws from Max Weber's (1922) conceptualization of legitimacy sources, particularly his distinction between traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational authority. Contemporary research by Norris and Inglehart (2019) on cultural evolution and political values provides empirical support for the persistence of competing legitimacy paradigms in democratic societies.

The triadic structure is informed by Haidt's (2012) Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies competing moral intuitions that shape political reasoning. However, this framework extends beyond moral psychology to examine the broader legitimacy claims that underpin political authority and democratic participation. Research by Kymlicka (1995) on multicultural citizenship and Young (1990) on justice and the politics of difference informs the identity-based legitimacy dimension, while work by Huntington (1996) on cultural conflict and Fukuyama (2018) on identity politics provides theoretical grounding for the dominance-based and universal dignity dimensions respectively.

**Core Theoretical Integration**:
- **Intersectionality Theory (Crenshaw, 1991)**: Political legitimacy centered on overlapping, unchosen personal attributes and lived experiences
- **Realist Political Theory (Machiavelli, 1532)**: Legitimacy through in-group supremacy and security in zero-sum competition
- **Liberal Dignity Theory (Kant, 1785)**: Legitimacy through transcendent dignity and agency of each person

Empirical validation comes from discourse analysis studies of political communication across diverse democratic contexts, including research by Fairclough (2003) on political discourse, van Dijk (2006) on political ideology, and Wodak (2015) on right-wing populist discourse. These studies demonstrate the consistent presence of competing legitimacy claims in political rhetoric and the need for systematic frameworks to analyze them.

## Analytical Methodology

The framework employs a structured analytical approach that examines each legitimacy source independently before integration, ensuring comprehensive coverage and avoiding analytical bias.

### **Framework Dimensions**

#### **Identity-Based Legitimacy**

**Immutable-Identity Politics (0.0-1.0)**
**Definition**: Politics that centers moral status on overlapping, unchosen personal attributes and lived experiences, emphasizing systemic oppression and intersectional analysis.

**Key Markers**: 
- **Identity-Based Claims**: "As Black women, we," "Center disabled queer voices," "Our lived experience as trans people," "as a [identity group]," "identity shapes perspective"
- **Intersectionality Language**: "intersection of race and gender," "multiple identities," "overlapping systems," "identity intersection," "compound identity," "intersectional"
- **Experience Authority**: "lived experience," "my experience," "our community knows," "identity-based knowledge," "lived reality," "group perspective"
- **Systemic Focus**: "systemic oppression," "structural discrimination," "institutional barriers," "marginalized identities face systemic barriers"
- **Identity Politics**: "identity matters," "representation counts," "diverse voices," "identity-conscious," "group-specific needs," "marginalized identities," "oppressed groups," "identity-based justice"

#### **Dominance-Based Legitimacy**

**Tribal Domination (0.0-1.0)**
**Definition**: Politics that asserts the legitimacy of an in-group's supremacy over out-groups, emphasizing group loyalty, cultural superiority, and exclusionary positioning.

**Key Markers**:
- **In-Group Supremacy**: "We must put our nation first," "They will replace us," "Only our tribe can secure the future," "our group first," "our people," "our interests," "group priority"
- **Zero-Sum Competition**: "take back our country," "us vs them," "win or lose," "dominate," "victory," "defeat them," "supremacy," "group survival"
- **Group Loyalty**: "real patriots," "true Americans," "our people," "loyal citizens," "tribal loyalty," "group strength," "collective power"
- **Cultural Assertion**: "dominant culture," "cultural superiority," "rightful place," "traditional values," "group hegemony," "tribal victory"
- **Threat Narratives**: "Our way of life is under threat," "foreign influence," "cultural invasion," "protect our group," "group defense"

#### **Universal Dignity Legitimacy**

**Pluralist Individual Dignity (0.0-1.0)**
**Definition**: Politics that locates legitimacy in the transcendent dignity and agency of each person, emphasizing universal rights, shared civic space, and individual potential.

**Key Markers**:
- **Universal Dignity**: "Every individual deserves equal voice," "Human dignity transcends race and class," "universal worth," "human dignity," "individual worth," "personal dignity," "inherent value"
- **Individual Agency**: "individual agency," "personal dignity," "human potential," "inherent value," "personal choice," "individual freedom," "autonomous decision," "self-determination," "personal agency"
- **Shared Civic Space**: "universal rights," "shared civic space," "common humanity," "civic equality," "equal respect," "civic equality," "universal principles," "equal treatment," "shared humanity"
- **Transcendent Values**: "consent-based governance," "democratic participation," "civic engagement," "universal values," "transcendent dignity," "common humanity," "moral equality," "inherent rights"

### **Sequential Analysis Approach**
To ensure analytical precision, the framework is designed for a sequential evaluation where each legitimacy paradigm is assessed independently before a final synthesis. This approach minimizes conceptual overlap and improves the quality of evidence for each dimension by allowing the analyst to focus exclusively on one legitimacy source at a time, reducing cognitive load and preventing cross-contamination between competing frameworks.

### **Evidence-Based Scoring**
Each dimension is scored based on:
- **Direct textual evidence** of legitimacy claims and appeals
- **Rhetorical emphasis** and salience within the overall message
- **Contextual analysis** of political positioning and moral authority claims
- **Confidence assessment** based on evidence clarity and consistency

### **Dynamic Salience Weighting**
The framework employs salience-based weighting to capture the relative importance of each legitimacy source within a given text:
- **High salience (0.8-1.0)**: Central to the political message and worldview
- **Medium salience (0.4-0.7)**: Present but not dominant in the discourse
- **Low salience (0.1-0.3)**: Peripheral or incidental to the main political claims
- **Absent (0.0)**: No evidence of this legitimacy source

**Salience vs Intensity Distinction**:
- **Intensity**: How strongly the worldview legitimacy source appears when demonstrated
- **Salience**: How much rhetorical space and emphasis the worldview source receives

### **Calculated Metrics & Pattern Classifications**

#### **Core Legitimacy Metrics**
- **Worldview Legitimacy Index**: Average score across all three legitimacy sources, calculated as (identity_score + dominance_score + dignity_score) / 3
- **Dominant Legitimacy Framework**: The legitimacy source with the highest score, determined using numpy's argmax function
- **Legitimacy Source Balance**: Distribution of scores across the three sources

#### **Advanced Analytical Metrics**
- **Identity-Dominance Tension**: Measures the conflict between identity-based and dominance-based legitimacy claims, calculated as abs(identity_score - dominance_score)
- **Dignity-Identity Alignment**: Assesses the coherence between universal dignity and identity-based approaches, calculated as 1 - abs(dignity_score - identity_score)
- **Tribal-Universal Tension**: Quantifies the opposition between tribal and universal legitimacy sources, calculated as abs(dominance_score - dignity_score)
- **Legitimacy Source Concentration**: Measures how concentrated legitimacy claims are in a single source, calculated as the standard deviation across all three dimension scores
- **Worldview Coherence Index**: Assesses the internal consistency of legitimacy source combinations, calculated as 1 - standard_deviation(scores), where higher values indicate more coherent worldview
- **Competitive Dynamics Index**: Measures the overall level of competitive tension between all legitimacy sources, calculated as the average of all pairwise absolute differences between dimension scores. This metric captures the fundamental incompatibility between competing legitimacy paradigms - higher values indicate greater worldview conflicts and strategic contradictions.
- **Political Strategy Coherence**: Assesses the coherence of political strategy across legitimacy sources, calculated as 1 - competitive_dynamics_index. This metric provides an inverse measure of strategic coherence - higher values indicate more coherent political strategy with fewer internal contradictions between legitimacy claims.

#### **Competitive Dynamics Analysis**
The framework identifies rich competitive relationships between legitimacy sources:

**Identity vs. Dignity**: Tension between group-based claims and universal principles
- **Conflict**: When identity politics emphasizes group-specific needs while dignity politics emphasizes universal equality
- **Synthesis**: When identity politics acknowledges universal dignity principles while maintaining group-specific analysis

**Domination vs. Dignity**: Conflict between supremacist and egalitarian visions
- **Conflict**: When tribal domination asserts in-group supremacy while dignity politics emphasizes universal human worth
- **Tension**: When security concerns (tribal) conflict with universal rights (dignity)

**Identity vs. Domination**: Competition between different forms of group-based politics
- **Conflict**: When identity politics emphasizes marginalized group empowerment while tribal domination asserts dominant group supremacy
- **Strategic Positioning**: How speakers navigate between identity-based and dominance-based legitimacy claims

#### **Pattern Classifications**
- **Mono-Legitimacy**: Single dominant legitimacy source (>0.7, others <0.3)
- **Dual-Legitimacy**: Two strong legitimacy sources (>0.5 each)
- **Balanced Triad**: All three sources moderately represented (0.3-0.6 each)
- **Legitimacy Conflict**: High scores in opposing legitimacy sources (>0.6 in conflicting pairs)
- **Legitimacy Synthesis**: Integration of multiple legitimacy sources with coherent worldview

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

This framework is designed for analyzing political texts that contain explicit or implicit claims about political legitimacy, moral authority, and the basis for political action. It works best with:
- Political speeches and rhetoric
- Policy documents and political manifestos
- Political commentary and analysis
- Social movement communications
- Political party platforms and communications

The framework may be less suitable for purely descriptive or factual political reporting that lacks normative claims about legitimacy and authority.

    analysis_prompt: |
      You are an expert analyst specializing in political worldview analysis with enhanced salience assessment. Your task is to analyze the text for three competing legitimacy paradigms AND assess the salience (rhetorical prominence) of each worldview.

      CRITICAL: You must assess both INTENSITY (how strong each worldview is) and SALIENCE (how rhetorically prominent each worldview is) for all 3 dimensions.

      POLITICAL WORLDVIEW DIMENSIONS:
      - Immutable-Identity Politics: Identity-centered legitimacy with intersectional analysis
      - Tribal Domination: Group supremacy legitimacy in zero-sum competition
      - Pluralist Individual Dignity: Universal dignity legitimacy emphasizing individual agency

      For each dimension:
      1. Score intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on worldview strength and frequency
      2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and political emphasis
      3. Identify direct quotations supporting your assessment
      4. Provide confidence rating based on evidence clarity

      The salience ranking enables empirically-backed measurement of political strategy and worldview priorities.
